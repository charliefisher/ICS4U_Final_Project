----- Notes -----
On the first run through the program creates a separate universal transaction receipt and on the second run through 
(re opening of the application) it will create a new universal receipt that will remain for the rest of time

This was implemented so that the company can test the application (with false information) on the first run of 
the application (subsequent runs use a different universal receipt)
